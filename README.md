# PlutoSDR radio interface layer for Sionna

## Introduction

This repository hosts a project with focus on integration of the PlutoSDR radio within the Sionna framework.The primary objective is to facilitate testing and demonstrations of systems with a direct over-the-air connection, eliminating the necessity for a simulated radio channel. It utilizes PlutoSDR, a low-cost Software-Defined Radio (SDR) by Analog Devices. 

Currently 1T1R is implemented, but as the HW supports 2T2R, it could be implemented later.

The included jupyter notebook `Sionna_Pluto_SDR.ipynb` provides an end to end example on how to use the functionality in eager mode, and integrated into Keras model. Graph execution is not supported. 

Note: The code may well benefit from further optimization and clean-up, as the developer acknowledges not being a professional developer.

## Functionality

The system accepts modulated In-Phase and Quadrature (IQ) signals generated by the Sionna modulator. These signals are subsequently transmitted over the radio interface via the Transmission (TX) port of the radio equipment. Figure 1 shows an example of the real part of the original IQ samples and figure 2 show the power spectral density of the signal. These pictures are created with the `Sionna_Pluto_SDR.ipynb` notebook located in this repository. Apart from the modulator outputs, optionally SDR TX gain, RX gain, and the number of additional unmodulated symbols for SINR calculation purposes can be set.

The transmission process utilises a cyclic transmission of the modulated signal. To facilitate the calculation of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SINR) estimates, 500 zero-modulated symbols are strategically inserted between successive instances of the modulated signal. Following the reception, the observed signal is illustrated in Figure 3.

The transmitted and received signals undergo correlation analysis, and the starting point of the transmityted signal is subsequently determined.

Fig 4. Received signal with calculated start position

Upon successful synchronization, the Power Spectral Densities (PSD) for both the received signal and the accompanying noise can be calculated. The resulting PSD plots are visualized in Figure 6.

The received In-Phase and Quadrature (IQ) signals undergo scaling, aligning their magnitudes with those of the input signal to ensure compatibility with the Sionna demodulator. The output format is `[IQ, SINR, SDR_TX_GAIN, SDR_RX_GAIN, fails + 1, corr, sdr_time]`

In the author's environment, the entire transmit-receive process typically takes between of 25 to 40 milliseconds.

## Disclaimer: Legal Compliance in Radio Transmission

It is imperative to acknowledge that engaging in radio transmission activities, especially over the air, mandates strict adherence to regulatory and licensing requirements. The use of devices like the PlutoSDR for transmitting radio signals must be conducted responsibly and legally.

1. **Obtain Required Licenses**: Before initiating any radio transmission, ensure you have obtained all necessary licenses and permissions from the appropriate regulatory bodies.
2. **Follow Frequency Allocations**: Adhere to the designated frequency bands and power levels to prevent interference with licensed services and other critical communication systems.
3. **Ensure Safety**: Ensure that your transmission activities do not pose any risks to public safety or disrupt other lawful communication services.

Engaging in unauthorized radio transmission can result in severe legal consequences, including fines, legal actions, and the confiscation of equipment.
